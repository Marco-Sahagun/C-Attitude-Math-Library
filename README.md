**Attitude Math Library**

A C++ library for representing and manipulating attitude in 3D space, including implementations for Direction Cosine Matrices (DCMs), Euler Angles, and Quaternions.
Features

Represent attitude using DCMs, Euler Angles, and Quaternions
Convert between different attitude representations
Calculate transforms between different reference frames
Efficient C++ implementation

**Background**

This library was developed  from Steve Dumble's course on attitude representation. It aims to provide a robust tool for engineers, game developers, and 3D graphics programmers working with 3D rotations and orientations. I would highly recommend this course. I plan to take more of his courses.
